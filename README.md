# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python 3. It allows you to play against the computer.

## Requirements

- Python 3

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to start the game:

`main.py`

4. The game will display an empty 3x3 grid, representing the Tic Tac Toe board.

5. Each cell on the board is represented by its row and column number. To make a move, enter the row and column numbers separated by a space. For example, to place your symbol in the top-right cell, enter `0 2`.

6. The game will alternate turns between you and the computer. You are represented by the symbol "X", and the computer is represented by the symbol "O".

7. The game will continue until one player wins or the board is filled with no winner. The winner is the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

8. After the game ends, you will be prompted to play again. Enter "yes" to start a new game or "no" to exit.
